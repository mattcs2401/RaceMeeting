Issues:
-------
-> Recycler view last item not showing properly, bottom cut off.
-> MeetingPreferences toolbar overlaying system icons, should be down a bit.
-> Logic flaw in how the difference between reminder time and race time is calculated.
-> Crash. In a reminder, select review, in the Details screen select Edit.

------
To Do:
------
(in no particular order)
-> Review functionality of the notification service and associated task ()not working properly:
   -> Multiple notifications.
   -> Time when notifications are supposed to happen.
-> Saved instance states, implement properly.
-> Rotation:
   -> have landscape view of main fragment left side and detail fragment right side.
   -> or simply lock to portrait.
-> Determine if time is yesterday or today.
-> What to do about a meeting entry from a previous day ?
-> Image for left of listing item, e.g. if race code is R then image of horse.
-> Format and style of DeleteDialog.
-> Implement a swipe to delete ? Have an Undo ?
-> Start updating documentation, proper comments etc.

Usability:
-> When the app comes to the foreground, after some other app, and the highlight preference is
   enabled, then check times and update display accordingly, as well as starting the service.
-> When the highlight preferrence is turned off, then revert the display back 'normal'.
