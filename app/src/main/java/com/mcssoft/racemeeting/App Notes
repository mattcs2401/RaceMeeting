-------
Issues:
-------
-> Recycler view last item not showing properly, bottom cut off.
-> MeetingPreferences toolbar overlaying system icons, should be down a bit.

----------
Usability:
----------
-> When the app comes to the foreground, after some other app, and the highlight preference is
   enabled, then check times and update display accordingly, as well as starting the service.
-> When the highlight preferrence is turned off, then revert the display back 'normal'.

-----------------
To Do (possibly):
-----------------
(in no particular order)
-> Re-assess how MeetingPreferences can be used within PreferencesFragment.
-> Review functionality of the notification service and associated task for multiple notifications.
-> Saved instance states, implement properly.
-> Rotation:
   -> have landscape view of main fragment left side and detail fragment right side.
   -> or simply lock to portrait ?
-> Determine if time is yesterday or today.
-> Icons to indicate today/yesterday meeting entries ?
-> Image for left of listing item, e.g. if race code is R then image of horse.
-> Format and style of DeleteDialog.
-> Implement a swipe to delete ? Have an Undo ?
-> Update documentation, proper comments etc.
