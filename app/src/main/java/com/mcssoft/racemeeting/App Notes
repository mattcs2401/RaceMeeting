-------
Issues:
-------
-> Recycler view last item not showing properly, bottom cut off.
-> MeetingPreferences toolbar overlaying system icons, should be down a bit.

----------
Usability:
----------
-> When the app comes to the foreground, after some other app, and the highlight preference is
   enabled, then check times and update display accordingly, as well as starting the service.
-> When the highlight preferrence is turned off, then revert the display back 'normal'.

-----------------
To Do (possibly):
-----------------
(in no particular order)
-> 'Show' Preference:
   -> Show (time and) date for previous meetings ? Current meetings just show time ?
      -> Remove the P and T for 'Show all meetings' ?
-> Review functionality of the notification service and associated task for multiple notifications.
   -> Need to loop on multiples with the same start (race) time.
-> Show full date/time in DetailFragment.
-> Saved instance states, implement properly.
-> Image for left of listing item, e.g. if race code is R then image of horse.
-> Implement a swipe to delete ?
   -> Have an Undo ?
   -> Then long press has some other use ?
-> Rotation: have landscape view of main fragment left side and detail fragment right side.
-> Update documentation, proper method and other comments etc.
